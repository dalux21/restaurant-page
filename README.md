# Restaurant Page.

A made up page of a restaurant. [Live Demo](https://davidelucifora.github.io/restaurant-page)

### Project description.

The purpose of this exercise was just to learn to use Webpack and ES6 Modules and to render an entire site dynamically using JS. I didn't focus too much on styling the UI like I would in a real life project example as I used this exercise just to learn to render the DOM using just ES6 JS modules (e.g. header.js, footer.js, contact.js etc.) and put everything together using Webpack. It uses tab switching navigation on a single page rendered through JS rather than separate HTML files, this was also a way to exercise my learnings around DOM Manipulatin.

### Things I learned
1. How to use Webpack for my projects
2. How to use ES6 Modules in my projects
3. How to tie up together and render a website using just JS
